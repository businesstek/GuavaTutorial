 * Guava's common.graph is a library for modeling graph-structured data, that is, entities and the relationships between them.
 * A graph consists of a set of nodes (also called vertices) and a set of edges (also called links, or arcs); each edge connects nodes to each other. The nodes incident to an edge are called its endpoints.
